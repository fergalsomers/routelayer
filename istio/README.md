# istio setup

This folder contains [setup.sh](/istio/setup.sh) script that is used to install istio on a running K8 cluster. The simplest way to do this is via the istioctl tool. 

The setup script uses Docker to first proivde values for istio-profile.yaml file from istio-profile-template.yaml. It then uses 1.23 istio docker file to run istioctl against the K8 cluster (using the kubeconfig generated by kind) to install istio (using the generated profile). 

Once complete, istio has been installed on the K8 cluster.
